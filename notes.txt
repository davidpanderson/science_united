    too-large CPU times?
        maybe because of existing (pre-SU) totals?
====================
Allocation
--------------
The way in which computing power is divided among projects and users.
"Hard allocation": one that guaranteed, based on assumptions
about volunteer pool.
--------------
goals: multi-objective
    honor hard allocations
    respect soft allocations
    respect user prefs
    maximize throughput
--------------    
We can estimate the total throughput of the system,
   and we can break it down by resource type,
   and for a given set of keywords we can see how much is not vetoed.

Goal: someone comes to SU with an allocation request, which includes
- the available app version types
    (CPU, NVIDIA, AMD, platform, VM)
- the set of keywords
- # FLOPs
We can tell them whether this can be granted, and if so starting when

Parameters:
- what % of resources to use for allocations (50?)
- max % for a single allocation (10?)

Projects also get an unallocated share,
with a fraction determined by the popularity of their keywords

to process an allocation request:
select hosts that aren't ruled out by keywords
total their flops for eligible resources
------------
SU serves as a scheduler at the level of project.
It keeps track of targets, allocations, balances, host assignments.
SU allocation is at the granularity of project.
If a project needs app- or user-level granularity it can either
    - run multiple BOINC projects, 1 per user/app
    - use BOINC's built-in allocation system

An "allocation" consists of
- an initial balance
- the rate of balance accrual
- the interval of balance accrual
where "balance" is in terms of FLOPs

There are two measures of work done:
1) REC, as reported directly by clients
2) credit, as reported by projects

2) is cheat-resistant, 1) is not
1) is up-to-date, 2) is not (long jobs, validation delay)

Approach:
use 1) from SU scheduling, but don't show it to volunteers
(eliminate incentive for cheating)

show 2) to volunteers.

?? what if SU assigns a host to a project, and the project doesn't have work?
	SU should work in a reasonable way for sporadic workloads
    BOINC client:
    if devices are idle, and scheduler RPC returns nothing
    do an AM RPC, but only every so often
    (min AM RPC interval?)
Need way for SU to check if project has work?
--------------
gives projects more allocation if they supply computing?
    No.  nanoHub users are going to attach to nanoHub, not SU

    Give projects more allocation if they supply news?

==================
RPC handler

when are accounts created?
on initial registration:
    pick N best projects based on prefs
        (same logic as in RPC handler)
    start account creation for those projects
on RPC:
    pick N best projects
    if not registered with any of them
        return highest-score project we are registered with
==================
client changes

represent user keyword sets as two vector<int>s

The following have keyword sets:
AM_ACCOUNT

Scheduler request: include

Eventually (to show keywords in GUI),
client needs to have master keyword list (keywords.xml)
    bundle with installer;
    refresh every 2 weeks;
    refresh if see unknown keyword ID
The following have keyword sets:
PROJECT
WORKUNIT

==================
server changes
workunit table has keywords as varchar 256
WU_RESULT has keywords as string
scheduler: maintain array of vector<int> corresponding to cache
    if look at job, keywords nonempty, vector empty: parse
    when remove from cache, clear vector

remote job submission:
batch can have keywords
each job in batch can have keywords

local job submission:
create_work takes kw ids
    (multi-job as well as single)
==================
keyword-based scheduling

submission: batch has keywords
copied to results (new DB field, 256 chars)

each volunteer reports yes/no keywords in sched request
	(AM can supply "project opaque" text, passed to projects)

score-based scheduling:
	"no" keyword match returns -1
	"yes" match adds 1

ensure non-starvation of jobs in cache
	add job age to score

Project keywords include a fraction flag
	(estimate fraction of work from that project with that keyword).
	100 means all work from project will have that keyword

If a user has a "no" keyword matching a project "all" keyword,
don't attach to that project.

Can compute:
	- the fraction of work from project that user can do
	- the fraction of work from project that user wants to do
==================
Project plan
- web site for register and prefs

- admin web interface for editing projects, apps, keywords, quotas

- RPC stubs for account creation, setting prefs

Overview
    SU targets a different population than the current BOINC user base:
        largely young (20s, 30s)
        ~half female
        primary motivation: science goals
        non-motivation: competition
            show user their own participation level over time
            no comparisons, leader boards
        science-oriented
        non-technical
            don't use words like FLOPS, CPU, or GPU
            OK: computer, job
    Simplicity
        hide information; TMI is a turn-off for target users
        hide features
    Graphical rather than textual display
    Keep the notion of "project" in the background.
    SU vs BOINC
        Ideally, we'd like an SU_branded version of BOINC.
        But until then, we explain that BOINC is software used by SU

instructions for alpha testers

Design doc
==================
testing and roll-out plan

- get scienceunited.berkeley.edu, su.berkeley.edu; get SSL working

- make 7.9 for win/mac;
    project list includes SU and boinc test

- announce SU to alpha testers; start testing

When SU is stable:
add SU to project list, non-test
fork/test/release 7.10

project stuff

Github
    learn project interface

communication channels

---------------------------

project app version info

need to know whether a host
a) can do work for a project at all
b) can use its GPU (s) for the project

where to store project AV info?

digest projects.xml and for each project produce a list of triples
(platform, GPU type, vbox flag)

store these either in JSON, XML, or serialize

function host_project_compatible() returns whether
    - host can do work for project at all
    - it can do work w/ vbox
    - it can do work using a GPU
-------------------
notion of backup project

Send 1-2 extra projects w/ zero resource share as backups,
in case higher-score project has no work, is down,
doesn't work for this host, etc.

More generally: we should notice if a host can't get work done
for a particular project, and treat it differently.
===========
New allocation model

share/total share = fraction of total FLOPS this project gets
balance = FLOPs owed to this project

daily accounting:
    x = total FLOPS in last day
    for each project p
        p.balance += x*(p.share/total_share)
        record balance, share in project accounting record

RPC
    for each project p
        p.balance -= reported EC

projected balance
    The idea is that there will be a ~24 period from
    when we start attaching a project to when
    the first reports of EC come in, and its balance declines.
    During that period we might over-attach it.

    So we could maintain a separate "projected balance",
    reset periodically to the balance,
    and decremented each time we attach the project by,
    say, half the estimated EC over the next day

    I'm not sure we need this; let's not do it for now.

========================
starvation

Some projects may be down, or have no jobs, for arbitrary periods.
If we attach a client to such projects, they'll starve.

This applies only to dynamic AMs;
use "send_rec" flag as proxy for this

Questions:

- When should the client make an "starved" RPC to SU?
    use exponential backoff 10 min .. 1 day to prevent flooding SU
    when a resource is idle
        we know this after doing a rr simulation
        write a func to do it fast!
            scan minimal # of jobs
    keep track of:
        first_starved: start of starvation interval, or zero
        starved_rpc_backoff: delay between starved RPCs, or zero
        starved_rpc_min_time: earliest time to do a starved RPC
    if using dynamic AM
        every 1 min
            check idle rsc
            if none
                first_starved = 0
            else
                if first_starved == 0
                    first_starved = now;
                    starved_rpc_backoff = 10 min
                    starved_rpc_min_time = now + 10 min
                else if now > starved_rpc_min_time
                    do AM RPC
                    starved_rpc_backoff = min(starved_rpc_backoff*2, 1 day)
                    starved_rpc_min_time = now + starved_rpc_backoff

    A starved RPC may not return any new projects (e.g. because of prefs)

- What additional info should be in the AM RPC request?
    for each project: flags saying we didn't get work
    we expected from this project, namely:
    - <sched_req_failed/>: last sched request failed
        get this from PROJECT::nrpc_failures
    - <sched_req_no_work>rsc</sched_req_no_work>
        last sched request requested work for rsc and didn't get any
        (not counting "too soon" error)
    set this stuff in PROJECT after scheduler req

- What changes to the scheduling algorithm are needed?
    in scan over projects:
    
    if last request failed or zero jobs, add to list but
        don't mark any resources
    if didn't get work for some resources, don't mark those resources
=============================
Anonymous accounts

Project accounts created by SU should be anonymous:
- User name is "Science United user random-str"
- email address is su_randomstring@nonexistent.domain
    different per project?
    I think so.
- password hash is random string (use new crypt code)

Purposes:
- simplify GDPR implementation
- reduce security risk (password guessing)
- eliminate stuff for resolving passwords
- let projects see how much computing comes from SU users

Implementation
DB:
add email_addr, passwd_hash to su_account

Web code:
change account creation
    if "email already exists", try new one
remove password resolution code

make script for handling existing accounts
===================
Group accounts

Projects may stop supporting account-create RPC.
So instead manually create accounts on each project.
Name "Science United",
email "scienceunited.org@gmail.com"

Add to project table
authenticator
weak_authenticator
Populate these for E@h, WCG

When creating account records for these projects,
create them immediately
====================
when a project changes from http: to https:

AM RPC:
if request includes a project w/ http: that is in our DB as https:,
tell it to detach from that project.
